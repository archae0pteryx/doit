A simple Digital Ocean cli (doctl) script for creating an instance and then retreive the ip for ssh purposes. I realze that doctl has an explicit ssh command however I do not have my rsa_keys in my $path and haven't bothered to look up passing identity files via the cli. 

The Ultimate goal is to pass kittens along and use the bare minimum effort. A lazy mans puppet or chef base.
