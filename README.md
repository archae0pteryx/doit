# Just D.O. it.
## Installation:
Get DOCTL https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl
Then BASH!
---- 
A simple Digital Ocean cli (doctl) script for creating an instance and then retreive the ip for ssh purposes. I realze that doctl has an explicit ssh command however I do not have my rsa_keys in my $path and haven't bothered to look up passing identity files via the cli. 

The Ultimate goal is to pass kittens along and use the bare minimum effort. A lazy mans puppet or chef base.


### Please note:
Due to the extremely large codebase I will not be accepting pull requests thank you.
