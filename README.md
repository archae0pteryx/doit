# Just D.O. it.
## Installation:

Then BASH!
----
A simple Digital Ocean cli (doctl) script for creating an instance and then retreive the ip for ssh purposes.

### Todo:
1. Better IP Grep - maybe cut -c?
2. Options to set non-default vars
3. Fix md5 fingerprinting
### Please note:
Due to the extremely large codebase I will not be accepting pull requests thank you.
